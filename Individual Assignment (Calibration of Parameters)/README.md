## Notes
1. To run the program you need to move the "RPCN imu calibration txt" folder to the desktop of the computer.
2. The program pauses when the figures are created. To proceed, close the figures.
3. At some point the user is prompted to enter an input (for which experiment (1-5) he/her wants to calculate the calibration parameters). 
Enter an integer between 1 and 5 to proceed.
